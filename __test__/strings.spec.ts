	/**
	 * A Javascript string with unpaired surrogates is not actually valid
	 * UTF-16, and so it cannot be round-tripped to UTF-8 and back.
	 * The recommended way to handle this is to replace each unpaired surrogate
	 * with \uFFFD (the "replacement character").
	 *
	 * Note a surrogate pair means two adjacent Javascript characters where the
	 * first is in the range \uD800 - \uDBFF and the second is in the
	 * range \uDC00 - \uDFFF.
	 * To be valid UTF-16, Javascript characters from these ranges must *only*
	 * appear in surrogate pairs. An *unpaired* surrogate means any such
	 * Javascript character that is not paired up properly.
	 *
