# BinaryPack

BinaryPack is 95% MessagePack. The protocol has been extended to support distinct string and binary types.

This library is mainly used by [PeerJS](https://peerjs.com) to transfer objects via data channels.
Bug reports and fixes are welcome, but we are unlikely to implement new features.
